# Simon-Game-Project
This repository contains an interactive Simon game implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The Simon game is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. The goal is to match the increasingly complex pattern without making a mistake.
